# Project Background

# Data Cleaning/Organization

This part provides a concise summary of the data cleaning and organization steps for the four datasets: `width.csv`, `thickness.csv`, `stereo_phys.csv`, and `plm.csv`.

## width.csv

1. **Data Loading**: The dataset was loaded into the variable `width`.
2. **Column Removal**: Averages and standard deviation columns were deleted.
3. **Text Cleaning**: "Tape" was removed from the `X` column.
4. **Data Type Conversion**: Values in columns 1-10 were converted to numeric.
5. **Row Removal**: Rows containing NAs and "tape 7" were removed.
6. **Renaming Columns**: Columns were renamed to a specific format.
7. **Data Transformation**: The dataset was reshaped to a longer format.

## thickness.csv

1. **Data Loading**: The dataset was loaded into the variable `thickness`.
2. **Column Removal**: Averages and standard deviation columns were deleted.
3. **Text Cleaning**: "Tape" was removed from the `X` column.
4. **Data Type Conversion**: Values in columns 1-10 were converted to numeric.
5. **Row Removal**: Rows containing NAs and "tape 7" were removed.
6. **Renaming Columns**: Columns were renamed to a specific format.
7. **Data Splitting**: Data was split into `thickness_ba` and `thickness_backing`.
8. **Data Transformation**: Both subsets were reshaped to a longer format.
9. **Data Merging**: Merged `width`, `thickness_ba`, and `thickness_backing` into a single dataset named `data`.

## stereo_phys.csv

1. **Data Loading**: The dataset was loaded into the variable `stereo`.
2. **Column Removal**: Columns `X.4` to `X.9` were removed.
3. **Text Cleaning**: "Tape" was removed from the `X` column and the `-` value in the `X.3` column was replaced with "no color".
4. **Renaming Columns**: Columns were renamed to descriptive names.
5. **Data Merging**: Physical data from `stereo` was merged with the `data` dataset.

## plm.csv

1. **Data Loading**: The dataset was loaded into the variable `plm`.
2. **Column Removal**: Columns `X.7` to `X.12` were removed.
3. **Row Removal**: Rows corresponding to "tape 7" and the last two rows were removed.
4. **Renaming Columns**: Columns were renamed to descriptive names.
5. **Text Cleaning**: The `-` value in the `plm_color` column was replaced with "no color".
6. **Data Transformation**: The `BOPP` column was converted to binary values.
7. **Data Merging**: Physical data from `plm` was merged with the `data` dataset.

## Encoding Data

1. **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Several columns were encoded into numeric values.
2. **Data Type Conversion**: Converted several categorical columns to numeric.

# Methods

The methods used to analyze the differences between each of the 22 tapes involve calculating distances between the tapes and then visualizing their distances from each other. Distances were calculated using a combination of absolute differences as well as the Hamming loss. Visualization of these distances were generated using the methods of Multidimensional Scaling and K-means clustering.

## Distances

Variables for each of the tapes included three numerical variables (width, thickness of backing, and thickness of backing and adhesive) as well as 12 categorical variables. To calculate the distance between two tapes, the following equation was used. $$\begin{align} D(T_i, T_j) &= \sum_{k=1}^{15} d(T_{ik}, T_{jk})\\\\ &= |T_{i1} - T_{j1}| + |T_{i2} - T_{j2}| + |T_{i3} - T_{j3}| + H(T_{i4}, T_{j4}) + \dots + H(T_{i15}, T_{j15}) \end{align}\\$$ where $H(T_{im}, T_{jm})$ is 1 if $T_{im} \neq T_{jm}$ and 0 if $T_{im} = T_{jm}$ for $m = 4, 5,..., 15$.

The above distance formula for two tapes sums the difference between each of the 15 variables, comparing the average width of one tape with the average width of another tape, the surface color of one tape with the surface color of another tape, etc. For each of the three numerical variables, the difference was calculated by taking the absolute value of the difference between values. For the remaining 12 categorical variables the Hamming loss was calculated by summing the number of categorical variables where the value of the first tape is not equal to the value of the second tape. The Hamming loss added to the three numerical variable differences provides the distance between two tapes $i$ and $j$.

With $n=22$ different tapes, there are $\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = 231$ different pairs of tapes and therefore, 231 different pairwise distances.

## Multidimensional Scaling

Multidimensional scaling is a technique used to visualize the similarities or dissimilarities between tapes by plotting them on a two dimensional plot. Although the data for each tape is multivariate, multidimensional scaling preserves the distances between pairwise observations when plotting. Multidimensional scaling in R takes in a symmetric matrix of dissimilarities (in this case a 22x22 symmetric matrix of the distances between each tape) and returns a set of 22 points where the distances between each point is approximately equal to the dissimilarities between each point. These points are then plotted on a two dimensional scatter plot to visualize the "closeness" of the tapes.

## K-means Clustering

Further visualization of differences between tapes can be conducted through K-means clustering. The set of 22 points from multidimensional scaling is passed into a function that partitions the points into $k$ clusters or groups. These groups are represented by its center, which is the mean of the points assigned to that cluster. The groups are determined to be the minimized sum of squares from the points to their assigned cluster center.

There are many different methods of calculating the optimal number of clusters in K-means clustering. For this analysis, the gap statistic was used whereby the dispersion within each cluster is compared. Once the optimal value of $k$ is chosen, K-means clustering groups the tapes into k groups and we are able to overlay these groupings on the two dimensional scatter plot of the tapes to analyze their proximity.
