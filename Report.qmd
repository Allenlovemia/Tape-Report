# Project Background

# Data Cleaning/Organization

# Methods

The methods used to analyze the differences between each of the 22 tapes involve calculating distances between the tapes and visualizing their distances from each other. Distances were calculated using a combination of absolute differences as well as Hamming Loss distances. Visualization of these distances were generated using the methods of Multidimensional Scaling and K-means clustering.
